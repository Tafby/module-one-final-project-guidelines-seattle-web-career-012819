Welcome to Alpha Super Ultra Purple!

In this program, you can
1. Catch Pokemon
2. View caught Pokemon in your pokedex
3. View the information of any pokemon in the pokedex
4. Battle a trainer

Install Instructions
1. Migrate Database using: rake db:migrate
2. Set the limit in api_communicator.rb:ln:8. This is the number of pokemon in the database
3. The database will seed, then you will be shown a cli prompt for your options
  3a. If you do not want the database to seed the second time you run the program (as it takes a while and will create duplicates), comment out cli.rb:ln:12 and cli.rb:ln:13
